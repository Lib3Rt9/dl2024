Some simple funny rules for prefix: :)

+ for a new feature
- for a modified feature
* for a bugfix
! for an important note

Note for different versions

- The test_code folder contains the testing versions
- The saved_model folder contains the saved model of the testing file which the names suggest


- For the OFFICIAL version:
-   Official_21 code and equivalent model - test21 is the based testing version with really small dataset - aims for speed
-   OFFICIAL_22 code and equivalent model - test21 with shoe_sandal_boot dataset - 300 images
-   OFFICIAL_22 code and equivalent model - test21 with shoe_sandal_boot_reduced dataset - 210 images - less data than OFFICIAL_22


-> Basically, these three OFFICIAL code are the same.


  However, it is best to see the versions: OFFICIAL_22 and OFFICIAL_23
